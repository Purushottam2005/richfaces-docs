		<title>JSF 2 integration</title>
		<para>
			JavaServer Faces (<acronym>JSF</acronym>) is the Java-based web application framework upon which the RichFaces framework has been built. RichFaces is now integrated with JSF 2, which features several improvements to the framework.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The standard display technology used by JSF 1 was JavaServer Pages (<acronym>JSP</acronym>). With JSF 2, the standard display technology has been changed to Facelets, which is a more powerful and more efficient View Declaration Language (<acronym>VLD</acronym>) than JSP.

		<title>Performance optimization</title>
		<para>
			The RichFaces framework includes several components designed to improve application performance. Script and style management can be optimized with resource-loading components such as <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:loadBundle&gt;</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:loadScript&gt;</sgmltag>, and <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:loadStyle&gt;</sgmltag>.
		</para>
		<para>
			For further details on optimizing the performance of RichFaces applications, refer to the <citetitle pubwork="chapter">Resources</citetitle> and <citetitle pubwork="chapter">Processing management</citetitle> chapters in the <citetitle>Component Reference Guide</citetitle>.

	<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Advanced_features-Filters">
		<title>Filters</title>
		<para>
			RichFaces uses a filter to correct the code received on an Ajax request. During a regular JSF request, a browser makes corrections independently. For Ajax requests, a filter is needed to prevent layout destruction. This is because a received code could differ from a code validated by a browser, and a browser does not make any corrections. Refer to <xref linkend="sect-Developer_Guide-Architecture-Ajax_Filter" /> for further details on how the Ajax filter works.
		</para>
		<para>
			<xref linkend="exam-Developer_Guide-Filters-Example_filter" /> shows how to set a filter in the <filename>web.xml</filename> file of an application.
		</para>

<programlisting language="XML" role="XML"><xi:include href="extras/exam-Developer_Guide-Advanced_features-Example_filter.xml_sample" parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
</programlisting>
		</example>
		<para>
			Different types of filters can be configured for pages in the same application. There are three filter types: 
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><literal>TIDY</literal></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The <literal>TIDY</literal> filter type is based on the <emphasis>Tidy</emphasis> parser. It is recommended for applications with complicated or non-standard markup. All necessary code corrections are made by the filter when a response comes from the server.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><literal>NEKO</literal></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The <literal>NEKO</literal> filter type replaces the "Fast Filter", and is based on the <emphasis>Neko</emphasis> parser. This filter considerably accelerates all Ajax request processing. However, the filter code is not strictly verified: if it is used with application markup that is non-standard or incorrect, it may cause errors and corrupt the application layout.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><literal>NONE</literal></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							No correction is performed.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
			</variablelist>

			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><code>/pages/performance\.xhtml,/pages/default.*\.xhtml</code></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							These pages do not use a filter for correction, as they are specified as using <literal>NONE</literal>. If a page is not covered by this set, it is checked against the next set (the set using the <literal>NEKO</literal> filter).
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><code>/pages/repeat\.xhtml</code></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							These pages use the <literal>NEKO</literal> filter for correction. If a page is not covered by this set, it uses the <literal>TIDY</literal> filter for code correction as specified with the <parameter>ORDER</parameter> parameter.

		<title>Error handling</title>
		<para>
			RichFaces allows standard handlers to be defined for processing different application exceptions. Custom JavaScript can be executed when these exceptions occur.
		</para>

		<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Advanced_features-Client-side_errors">
			<title>Client-side errors</title>
			<para>
				JSF provides a global <code>onError</code> handler on the client. The handler provides the relevant error code and other associated data. The RichFaces Ajax components provide the <varname>error</varname> attribute if extra functionality needs to be defined.
			</para>
			<para>

			</para>
			<itemizedlist>

	<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Advanced_features-Managing_states" status="draft">
		<title>Managing states</title>
		<para>
			JavaServer Faces (<acronym>JSF</acronym>) has an advanced navigation mechanism that allows you to define navigation from one view to another. Navigation typically happens in a web application when a user moves from one page to another, but there is no switch mechanism between certain logical states in the same view. The RichFaces State API allows sets of states to be defined for the views, as well as any properties associated with these states.
		</para>
		<para>
			Actually States is a map where the entry key is a name of the State and the value is a State map. Particular State map has entries with some names as keys and any objects as values that are used after the state activation. Thus, in the State map you could define any values, method bindings, or just some simple state variables (constants) which have different values for every State.
