    <title>Creating projects in different IDEs</title>
    <para>      
	    As you could have mentioned the process of the JSF component creation
	    is pretty labor-intensive but repeatable. 
	    During the CDK Guide you have created a simple 
	    <property><emphasis role="bold">&lt;rich:inputDate&gt;</emphasis></property> component.
	    However when creating components in the wild you need debugger, class browser, 
	    object inspector, class hierarchy diagram, etc.
	    to simplify development process and maximize productivity. 
	    In other words you need an IDE. 
    </para>
    <para>
    	The question is what IDE is more suitable for the JSF component development.
    	There is no one answer for this question and the right of private judgment in matters of choosing IDE, 
    	is better secured to us than to any other people in the world.
    </para>
    <para>    
    	Eclipse IDE seems to be more preferable for the rapid component creation process.
