  <para><application>RichFaces</application> is a library for adding rich user
  interface features to JSF applications. It extends the <application><ulink
  url="http://www.jboss.org/projects/jbossajax4jsf">Ajax4jsf</ulink></application>
  framework to include a large (and growing) set of powerful rich AJAX-enabled
  components that come with extensive skins support.</para>

  <para><application>RichFaces</application> components enable the easy integration
  of AJAX-based <quote>richness</quote> into business application development.
  Because the components come ready to use out-of-the-box, you can take
  advantage of them quickly. In addition, <application>RichFaces</application>
  components are designed to be used seamlessly with other 3d-party component
  libraries on the same page, so you have more options in how you develop
  applications.</para>

  <para><application>RichFaces</application> skins enable greater flexibility in
  developing the visual appearance of business applications.
  <application>RichFaces</application> comes with a number of predefined skins to
  get you started, but you can also easily create your own custom skins. Also,
  during application run-time, skins and skin parameters can be changed
  programmatically.</para>
