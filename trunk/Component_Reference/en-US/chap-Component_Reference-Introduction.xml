		<title>Libraries</title>
		<para>
			The RichFaces framework is made up of two tag libraries: the <classname>a4j</classname> library and the <classname>rich</classname> library. The <classname>a4j</classname> tag library represents Ajax4jsf, which provides page-level Ajax support with core Ajax components. This allows developers to make use of custom Ajax behavior with existing components. The <classname>rich</classname> tag library provides Ajax support at the component level instead, and includes ready-made, self-contained components. These components don't require additional configuration in order to send requests or update.
		</para>
		<note>
			<title>Ajax support</title>
			<para>
				All components in the <classname>a4j</classname> library feature built-in Ajax support, so it is unnecessary to add the <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:support&gt;</sgmltag> behavior.
