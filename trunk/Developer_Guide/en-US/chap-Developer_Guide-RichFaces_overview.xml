	<title>RichFaces overview</title>
	<para>
		The RichFaces framework is a component library which enhances JSF Ajax capabilities, such that you don't need to write any extra JavaScript code or replace any existing components with new Ajax widgets. RichFaces also enables page-wide Ajax support instead of the traditional component-wide support. Events can be defined on pages that invoke Ajax requests. After an Ajax request, the areas of a page that are synchronized with the JSF Component Tree can themselves change data on the server according to events fired on the client.

		Using JSF tags, RichFaces allows different parts of a JSF page to be updated with an Ajax request. JSF pages using RichFaces do not change from "regular" JSF pages, and additional JavaScript code is not required.

		<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Architecture-Ajax_Filter">
			<title>Ajax Filter</title>
			<para>
				To get all benefits of RichFaces, a filter should be registered in the <filename>web.xml</filename> file of your application. The filter recognizes multiple request types. Filter configuration is covered in detail in <xref linkend="sect-Developer_Guide-Advanced_features-Filters" />. <xref linkend="figu-Developer_Guide-Ajax_Filter-Request_processing_sequences" /> shows the difference between processing a regular JSF request and an Ajax request with a filter. With the regular JSF request, the whole JSF tree is encoded. With the Ajax request, the filter parses the content of an Ajax response before sending it to the client side, and encoding depends on the size of the Ajax region.

				Both with and without a filter, the required static or dynamic resources that your application requests are registered in the <classname>ResourseBuilder</classname> class. <xref linkend="figu-Developer_Guide-Ajax_Filter-Resource_request_sequence" /> shows the differences in resource requests for a regular JSF request and an Ajax request with a filter. When a request for a resource occurs, the RichFaces filter checks the <classname>ResourceCache</classname> for the resource. If the resource is in the cache, it is sent to the client. Otherwise, the filter searches for the resource among those that are registered by the <classname>ResourceBuilder</classname>. If the resource is registered, the RichFaces filter will send a request to the <classname>ResourceBuilder</classname> to deliver the resource.

			<title>Ajax Action Components</title>
			<para>
				The RichFaces framework includes several Ajax Action Components: <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:commandButton&gt;</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:commandLink&gt;</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:poll&gt;</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:support&gt;</sgmltag>, and more. Use Ajax Action Components to send Ajax requests from the client side.

		<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Architecture-Ajax_Containers">
			<title>Ajax Containers</title>
			<para>
				<classname>AjaxContainer</classname> <remark>(name possibly changed in release)</remark> is an interface that describes an area on a JSF page that is decoded during an Ajax request. <classname>AjaxViewRoot</classname> and <classname>AjaxRegion</classname> are implementations of this interface.
			</para>
		</section>
		
		<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Architecture-Skins_and_theming">
			<title>Skins and theming</title>
			<para>
				RichFaces includes extensive support for application skinning. Skinning is a high-level extension to traditional <acronym>CSS</acronym> (Cascading Style Sheets) which allows the color scheme and appearance of an application to be easily managed. The skins simplify look-and-feel design by allowing multiple elements of the interface to be handled as manageable features, which have associated color palettes and styling. Application skins can additionally be changed on the fly during run-time, allowing user experiences to be personalized and customized.
			</para>
			<para>
				For full details on skinning and how to create skins for the components in your application, refer to <xref linkend="chap-Developer_Guide-Skinning_and_theming" />.

		<section id="sect-Developer_Guide-Architecture-RichFaces_JavaScript_Engine">
			<title>RichFaces JavaScript Engine</title>
			<para>
				The RichFaces JavaScript Engine runs on the client side. It can update different areas on a JSF page based on an Ajax response. It is not necessary to use the JavaScript code directly, as it is available automatically.
			</para>

		<para>
			RichFaces originated from the <emphasis>Ajax4jsf</emphasis> project, an open-source web application framework that added Ajax capabilities to the JavaServer Faces (<acronym>JSF</acronym>) framework. The RichFaces components were split into a separate commercial component library, then later both the Ajax4jsf and RichFaces libraries were re-combined under the RichFaces name.
		</para>
		<para>
			RichFaces 4.0 features full JSF2 integration and uses standard web application technologies such as JavaScript, <acronym>XML</acronym> (Extensible Markup Language), and <acronym>XHTML</acronym> (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language).

		<title>Restrictions</title>
		<para>
			The following restrictions apply to applications implementing the RichFaces framework: 
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Any Ajax framework should not append or delete elements on a page, but should instead replace them. For successful updates, an element with the same identifier as in the response must exist on the page. If it is necessary to append code to a page, include a placeholder for it (an empty element).
						<!-- For the same reason, it is recommended that messages be placed in the <sgmltag>&lt;a4j:outputPanel&gt;</sgmltag> component.-->
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<sgmltag>&lt;f:verbatim&gt;</sgmltag> should not be used for self-rendered containers, since it is transient and not saved in the tree.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<!--
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Ajax requests are made by XMLHTTPRequest functions in XML format, but this XML bypasses most validations and the corrections that might be made in a browser. As such, a strict standards-compliant code for HTML and XHTML should be used, without skipping any required elements or attributes. Any necessary XML corrections are automatically made by the XML filter on the server, but unexpected effects can be produced through incorrect HTML code.
					</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						The RichFaces <classname>ViewHandler</classname> puts itself in front of the Facelets <classname>ViewHandlers</classname> chain.
